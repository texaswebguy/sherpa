Why Sherpa?
------------------

####Consider the typical UX design process####

Most typical UX process associated with waterfall project methodology follow a structure similar to the steps below:

 - Requirements gathering
 - Scenarios & Use Cases (maybe)
 - Wireframes & UX annotations
 - Style guides and design comps
 - High fidelity prototypes (if enough time)
 - Usability sessions (if enough time)

At the end of this process a package with the above deliverables gets tossed over to the development team so they can build the application.


----------


####The Tower of Babel Syndrome####

The IT Project Manager, IT Analyst, developers and testers all independently have to look at all the deliverables above and drive to a singular conclusion, an application that is supposed to execute as recommended by the UX design team.

All these people who have different roles and most likely where not involved in the process of producing the UX deliverables are supposed to come to the same conclusion. Hence, the Tower of Babel Syndrome. The differing interpretation of this comprehensive UX documentation leads to poor communication, defects, timeline crunch and budget issues, etc.


----------


####Sherpa was Born####

Sherpa was born out of the need to embrace a faster "agile" UX methodology to innovate with speed and reduce the churn of a slow comprehensive process. We also wanted to produce work that wouldn't be so throw away and make our work to be more relevant to our development partners. Ultimately, if our designs fail, we wanted them to fail as fast and as cheap as possible.

####Let's revisit the Agile Manifesto####

 > **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

 > **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

 > **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

 > **Responding to change** over following a plan


----------


 - Sherpa emphasizes **individuals and interactions** by allowing people to explore concepts faster with all the latest technology without having to get bogged down with comprehensive and tedious tools that yield little or no reusable code.

 - Sherpa leverages **working software** with the ability to integrate in page annotation.

 - Sherpa enables **customer collaboration** by providing an interactive model of the concept as quick as possible to elicit feedback. 

 - Sherpa provides may ways of **responding to change** such as in-page editing of content.


In addition, one of Sherpa's primary objective is to create a prototype that does not require anything more than sending someone a zip file, they extract it, and double click the prototype. No installation of complex software, just click and go.


----------


####Technology at our fingertips####

Sherpa provides an advanced technology stack that is used by many developers. No need to put together a bunch of libraries on your own. When you download the starter kit, everything you need is ready to go. Everything you need to build a prototype as simple or as complex as you need. With libraries such as Angular and our own custom code, your prototype can even support multiple languages within minutes.


----------


####Working with developers####

With incorporation of Twitter Bootstrap's framework and ability to create themes, Sherpa is a perfect platform to share your CSS with developers.  The prototypes you work on will use the same markup that your production environment will render. At Dell, the UX team produces the CSS both for prototypes and production via Twitter Bootstrap LESS files.

Getting started is easy. Just download the starter kit and start experimenting. 
You will have to create your own theme but we provide the Dell theme so you can see how we did it.
