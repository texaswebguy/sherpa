Welcome to Sherpa!
=====================

Sherpa is an HTML prototyping framework for rapid creation of responsive, data driven and internationalized prototypes that enables a best-in-class user experience design processes. 

----------


The Problem
---------

If you are involved in the UX design process you can relate to this story; you've spent months in meetings, countless wireframes, comps, spreadsheets full of requirements, content documents, etcetera.

Now the project is in the hands of developer, armed with the documentation you painstakingly took a lot of time to prepare and throw over the wall. The developer, just into the project, has to distill a diversity of "deliverables" and conclude with the same picture, form and function the UX people had in mind.

> "Time, money and quality. You can have your pick, but you can only pick two of them"

Much to your dismay, the developer hardly reads any of the documentation and with an onslaught of meetings, you now have to reinvest in the project time to catch "defects" which ultimately are labeled "enhancements" by dev and out your project goes into production looking very different than what was designed.

**Sound familiar?**


The Solution
---------

Sherpa is about simplifying the typical plethora of UX deliverables into a **homogeneous design ecosystem** that provides a singular point of focus for business, design and development to communicate and agree.

Sherpa is NOT some proprietary whiz-bang technology. It is built and maintained by UX designers and architects collaborating with business people and developers. It is built to fill the needs of the UX, business and development communities equally and usher a process that is focused on velocity, accuracy and reuse. We embrace the fail fast culture.

Sherpa is built using open source technologies such as jQuery, Twitter Boostrap, Angular.js, underscore.js, Gridset CSS and many more. It is essentially a highly configurable ready-to-go open source technology stack that allows you to ramp up a very simple or sophisticated HTML prototype. Sherpa continues to evolve with one goal in mind, provide the best way to prototype web designs with REAL CODE.

Get Involved
---------

We want your input and collaboration! Let's make the framework better together.

Our development environment is quite simple.
>   - No Node.js
>   - No Grunt JS
>   - No minifying or uglifying
>   - Just fork it on [Github][github]

There is a reason for this. We want UX people to be involved in the evolution of this framework. Quite frankly, while Yeoman, Grunt, Node, etc. offer incredible development tools to build frameworks such as these, it is a NO STARTER for web design people. Therefore, we want to keep it off anything that makes it convoluted for the people we want in the forefront of innovating with this platform. (no offense to great tools mentioned above)
