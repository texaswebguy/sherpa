   <h3>Overview</h3>
   <p>Banners are created as part of the marketing assets we produce in order to promote products and services.</p>
   <p>Research has discovered that many users have "banner blindness" and typically ignore banners that they see on pages. This is not a justifiable reason to design visually loud banners, rather quite the opposite.&nbsp; We should strive to design banners that integrate well into the page and provide overall visual consistency, as well as enhance design and maintain brand integrity for Dell.com and our other online properties.</p>
   <p>In designing pages for Dell.com, we should ensure that we’re not putting unnecessary diversions in the way of our users’ critical tasks. To do this, let’s think of the shopping experience as a highway system.</p>
   <p>As users travel toward their destination, application data and labels are the signs that enable them to complete this task. It’s critical that these content elements are not only clear and direct, but also visually prominent.&nbsp; Banners and marketing messages, on the other hand, are like billboards – they provide choices and helpful diversions, but you would never plant them in the middle of a street or use them to obscure an exit sign.</p>
   <p>First, consider whether a banner is necessary at all on a task-oriented page (for example, Drivers and Downloads). If it’s necessary to include a banner on these types of pages, then the messaging on the banner should be relevant to the experience. The banners should also have a short lifespan. To ensure this happens, expiration dates must be coded into the CMS.</p>

      <h3>What is a banner?</h3>
      <p>Any click-able image asset with text and a call to action will be considered a banner, which must align to the standards covered in this document. Banners can also have dynamic HTML text as an overlay, or be created from a JavaScript or Flash file that has a call to action.</p>
