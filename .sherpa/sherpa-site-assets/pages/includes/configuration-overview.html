                <p class="sherpa" data-bind="msg: 'text_configuration_overview_description'">The Sherpa framework is highly configurable. Configurations are in place to adapt to the diverse needs in User eXperience (UX) prototype modeling. These configurations allow prototypes to run locally or from remote servers. In addition, different javascript libraries can be configured when the prototype page loads. This is done so the framework can be extended to fit your specific needs.</p>
                <p class="sherpa" data-bind="msg: 'text_configuration_overview_description_2'">Out of the box, Sherpa is loaded with everything we use to build prototypes ourselves and very seldom you might need to add or remove things. There are several places to configure Sherpa show below.</p>
